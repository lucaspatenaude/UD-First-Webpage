  <h1>Lucas' Webpage</h1>
  <p>One of my favorite things in the world is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey">ice hockey</a>. Growing up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota">Minnesota</a>, I was fortunate to grow up in an environment that allowed outdoor skating to be easily accessible and those frozen winter days skating with my childhood friends are some of my fondest memories. From the time I was 6 until I was 18 I had the <strong>privilege</strong> to be enrolled in competitive hockey and those days competing and playing are some of my <strong>formative</strong> and helped to shape a lifelong love of the game.</p>
